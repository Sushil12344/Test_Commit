What I can say
You need to just copy the repo path
and add it into the "Add existing repo" location field.
in the Name field you can give anything doesn't matter.
then in few seconds or minutes it will sync all the branches and info from github to your xcode. 
you can test it by go to pull and see branch list is coming or not.
Just take a pull for latest repo and go for push changes to remote repo.
push sends all the commits of local to remote.
